# Coin Tower Topple

**Coin Tower Topple** is a 2-player game where players add coins to a tower until it gets too high and "topples". A player wins the game when their opponent causes the tower to topple.

The game makes use of a machine learning technique called **Reinforcement Learning**, specifically *Q-Learning*, to train an AI agent to learn the optimal moves to maximize its chances of winning.

The game is written in Python and played in a terminal window. It is deployed on Heroku using Code Institute's mock terminal. You can access the live game here: (**#### ADD LINK ####**).

# Project Planning

The [**Project Planning**](project_planning.md) document outlines my personal goals for this project and includes flowcharts illustrating the code logic. I chose to create this game because:
- It provided an opportunity to explore Reinforcement Learning techniques in machine learning.
- My children and I have enjoyed playing a similar maths-based strategy game while walking to and from school!

# Target Audience

The target audience for this game is users who enjoy playing maths-based strategy games.

The game settings (*Difficulty Level*, *Topple Height*, and *Possible Actions*) can be adjusted to add variety and accommodate players of all skill levels.
